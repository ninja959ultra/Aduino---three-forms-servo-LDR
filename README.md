# Description:
Arduino---Joystick-Controlled-Servo-with-LED-and-Buzzer

This project is an Arduino-based control system that uses a joystick to interact with a servo motor, two LEDs, and a buzzer. The servo motor rotates based on the joystick's horizontal position, and visual/audible feedback is provided depending on the direction of movement.

---

Behavior:

Joystick moved to the right:

The servo angle increases, rotating toward the right.

The blue LED turns ON.

The buzzer is activated.


Joystick moved to the left:

The servo angle decreases, rotating toward the left.

The red LED turns ON.

The buzzer is activated.


Joystick in the center position:

The servo motor moves to its neutral/middle angle.

No LEDs are turned on.

The buzzer remains OFF.

This project demonstrates how to use a joystick to control servo positioning and provide direction-based alerts through lights and sound.
